    title: "Getting started",

      {
        q: "What is Corephia, exactly?",
        a: "Corephia is a physician-built weight loss program based in Tampa, Florida. It combines three things: dietitian services, an exercise prescription matched to your fitness level, and — when a licensed provider determines it is clinically appropriate — weight loss medication. You are enrolling in a program, not buying a prescription.",
      },
      {
        q: "How do I get started?",
        a: "Start with the intake form. It asks for your health history, your current medications and allergies, what a normal day of eating and movement looks like for you, and what you have already tried. Once you submit it, a member of our care team reaches out to arrange your first visit, and your provider reviews your answers before you meet.",
      },
      {
        q: "Who qualifies for the program?",
        a: "Eligibility is a clinical decision rather than a checkbox. A licensed provider reviews your intake, your medical history and your goals, then recommends a plan — including whether medication is appropriate for you. Some patients are a better fit for nutrition and exercise support on its own.",
      },
    ],
  },
  {
    title: "The program",
    items: [
      {
        q: "Is medication included in the price?",
        a: "What you pay for is the program. Medication is one part of that program, and it is prescribed only when a licensed provider determines it is clinically appropriate for you — it is never promised in advance, and it is never the whole plan. Corephia is not a medication storefront.",
      },
      {
        q: "Do I have to take medication to join?",
        a: "No. The program is built on dietitian services and a structured exercise prescription, and those stand on their own. Medication is added only if your provider judges it appropriate for your situation.",
      },
      {
        q: "What do the nutrition and exercise parts actually involve?",
        a: "A registered dietitian documents what they are recommending for you and builds your plan around what you actually eat, rather than handing you a template. Your exercise plan is prescribed the way medication is — matched to your current fitness level, your goals and what you can realistically sustain — and it progresses as you do.",
      },
      {
        q: "How quickly will I see results?",
        a: "That varies genuinely from person to person, and it depends on your starting point, your health history and which parts of the plan fit your life. Corephia is built for sustainable change rather than a fast number, so your provider tracks your progress at regular follow-ups and adjusts the plan instead of promising a timeline up front.",
      },
    ],
  },
  {
    title: "Safety and privacy",
    items: [
      {
        q: "Is this safe?",
        a: "Your care is delivered by licensed providers who review your complete history — your conditions, current medications, allergies and family history — before recommending anything. You are then seen at regular follow-ups, so your plan is monitored and adjusted rather than left to run on its own.",
      },
      {
        q: "Who will I be working with?",
        a: "A licensed provider oversees your medical care and a registered dietitian handles the nutrition side. Corephia was founded by Dr. Daniel Antonious, MD, who is double board certified in internal medicine and nephrology and is currently pursuing an additional fellowship in critical care.",
      },
      {
        q: "What happens to the health information I submit?",
        a: "Your intake is collected so that your care team can treat you, and you are asked to acknowledge how it will be used before you sign it. It is handled confidentially, and it is not used to sell you unrelated products.",
      },
    ],
  },
  {
    title: "Cost and coverage",
    items: [
      {
        q: "How much does the program cost?",
        a: `Membership is billed monthly, with a tier for the level of support you want: ${priceList}. Each tier lists exactly what it includes in the pricing section of our home page.`,
      },
      {
        // TODO: replace with a definitive answer once the client confirms whether
        // insurance, HSA and FSA payments are accepted.
        q: "Do you accept insurance?",
        a: "Coverage depends on your individual plan and on what your provider recommends for you, so the dependable answer comes from us directly rather than from a general statement. Contact us before you enroll and we will tell you what applies to your situation.",
      },
      {
        // TODO: replace with the actual list of licensed states once the client confirms it.
        q: "Where do you operate?",
        a: "Corephia is based in Tampa, Florida, and your care is provided by licensed providers. Because licensure determines where a provider is able to treat you, contact us to confirm that we can care for you where you live.",
