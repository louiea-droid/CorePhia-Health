// TEMPORARY. Real intake submissions are still zero (the intake form has no
// destination yet — see CLAUDE.md), so the real, Firebase-connected
// Dashboard and Patients pages have nothing to render or tune against.
// These are hand-written sample rows, NOT pulled from Firestore or
// seedRecords.js (that file is dev-server-only demo data, gated behind
// usingSeedData — these load in the real, signed-in admin whenever a real
// query genuinely returns zero documents). Delete this file once real
// submissions exist, and remove its two call sites in Dashboard.jsx and
// Patients.jsx.
